## Requirements
### General

- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line

## Tasks
### 0. What is my PID
Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

### 1. List your processes
Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

Requirements:

- Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
- Display in a user-oriented format
- Show process hierarchy

### 2. Show your Bash PID
Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

Requirements:

- You cannot use pgrep
- The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error [here](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/vErRT8QGU2bwJ6FLvPLzxw))

### 3. Show your Bash PID made easy
Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

Requirements:

- You cannot use ps

### 4. To infinity and beyond
Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.

Requirements:

- In between each iteration of the loop, add a sleep 2

### 5. Don't stop me now!
We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:
- You must use kill

### 6. Stop me if you can
Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

Requirements:

- You cannot use kill or killall

### 7. Highlander
Write a Bash script that displays:

- To infinity and beyond indefinitely
- With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
- I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal

Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

### 8. Beheaded process
Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

### 9. Process and PID file
Write a Bash script that:

- Creates the file /var/run/myscript.pid containing its PID
- Displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely
- Displays I hate the kill command when receiving a SIGTERM signal
- Displays Y U no love me?! when receiving a SIGINT signal
- Deletes the file /var/run/myscript.pid and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal

### 10. Manage my process
Read:
- [&](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/R4YSgPT1k0PhWCrB0TYzoQ)
- [init.d](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/sVqN4oNYYO6ojS4ctT02Jw)
- [Daemon](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/kCoQ5aYO3towdDQFVPcfNg)
- [Positional parameters](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/TJ2rxUwRsnM1mJQHSCnOQA)

man: sudo

Programs that are detached from the terminal and running in the background are called daemons or processes, need to be managed. The general minimum set of instructions is: start, restart and stop. The most popular way of doing so on Unix system is to use the init scripts.

Write a manage_my_process Bash script that:

- Indefinitely writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process
- In between every I am alive! message, the program should pause for 2 seconds

Write Bash (init) script 101-manage_my_process that manages manage_my_process. (both files need to be pushed to git)

Requirements:

- When passing the argument start:
    - Starts manage_my_process
    - Creates a file containing its PID in /var/run/my_process.pid
    - Displays manage_my_process started
- When passing the argument stop:
    - Stops manage_my_process
    - Deletes the file /var/run/my_process.pid
    - Displays manage_my_process stopped
- When passing the argument restart
    - Stops manage_my_process
    - Deletes the file /var/run/my_process.pid
    - Starts manage_my_process
    - Creates a file containing its PID in /var/run/my_process.pid
    - Displays manage_my_process restarted
- Displays Usage: manage_my_process {start|stop|restart} if any other argument or no argument is passed

Note that this init script is far from being perfect (but good enough for the sake of manipulating process and PID file), for example we do not handle the case where we check if a process is already running when doing ./101-manage_my_process start, in our case it will simply create a new process instead of saying that it is already started.

### 11. Zombie
Read [what a zombie process is.](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Tb86ZoSxR6ORCKYlZaYzHw)

Write a C program that creates 5 zombie processes.

Requirements:

- For every zombie process created, it displays Zombie process created, PID: ZOMBIE_PID
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- When your code is done creating the parent process and the zombies, use the function bellow
```
int infinite_while(void)
{
    while (1)
    {
        sleep(1);
    }
    return (0);
}
```
